# Eating-fruit-game
Welcome to the "Eating Fruit" game repository!

This game is a fun and simple game that I created using the Python Pygame library. The objective of the game is to guide the "snack" (a large black square) to eat as many "fruits" (small black squares) as possible. Each fruit eaten will earn you 10 points.

The game features a score system that keeps track of your current score, and also allows you to change the color of the snake through the menu option. This allows you to customize your gaming experience and make it more enjoyable.

The game is easy to play, simply use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen and try to eat as many fruits as possible before time runs out.

The code is open-source and available for anyone to view, contribute to, or download. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue on the repository or submit a pull request.

Thank you for checking out the "Eating Fruit" game and happy playing!
